          "body": "It would be great to speed up the tests, but we might need to make some changes in our test code to guarantee that each test is isolated from any other tests that could be running in parallel.\n\nOne example is {{TestLocalFSFileContextMainOperations}} and {{TestFcMainOperationsLocalFs}}.  Both of these are subclasses of {{FileContextMainOperationsBaseTest}}.

          "body": "By coincidence I've been working on this recently. As Chris is pointing out, just turning on parallel testing in Surefire would lead to various problems as current tests are not ready to be used this way. So what I did is fixed hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common and hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs to allow such execution, and the results seem positive.\n\nThe amount of changes required to remove contention among tests is not small, but the changes are straightforward. Parallel execution may be turned on by activating profile \"parallel-tests\". Number of forks to use may be tuned using -DtestsThreadCount (4 is the default). \n\nMost of changes in hadoop-common are related to FileContextTestHelper and FileSystemTestHelper -- some static methods are transformed into instance methods, to make tests use different directories by default. Tests which depend on these classes are changed accordingly.\n\nMost of changes in hadoop-hdfs are related to MiniDFSCluster. Earlier, most of tests used the same dir to place MiniDFSCluster data. The modifications make every MiniDFSCluster instance to use a new dir (by default). When several instances need to use the same dir, it needs to be set explicitly using MiniDFSCluster.Builds.dfsBaseDir(dfsBaseDir). \n\nAs I know MiniDFSCluster is used in other projects like HBase so changing it's API and default behavior may lead to issues there. So I left all existing methods intact, marking some of them as deprecated, and introduced an environment var which switches new behavior on, and by default the old single dir behavior is active. \n\nCurrently it takes 7min to run hadoop-common tests with 4 parallel forks on my 4core laptop, vs 15min in sequential mode. For hdfs it's 42min vs 1hr 39min. It may give even a bigger improvement if used on a CI node with many cores. \n\nI'm still in process of testing this. In particular, I'm going to verify projects which depend on Mini cluster infrastructure like HBase, Pig and Hive.\n\nMy existing patch is for both hadoop-common and hadoop-hdfs. The tests in these modules are coupled and changing one without changing the other wouldn't work. Tsuyoshi, do you mind if I change the title of this task adding HDFS and reassign it to myself? \n",

The speedup sounds impressive!\n\nWhen you're ready to publish the patch, I'd like to make sure that we test on Windows too.  More specifically, I'd like to test the effect of merging it to branch-trunk-win.  If you don't have access to a Windows VM, I'd be happy to test the patch myself.\n\nOne thing we've noticed during Windows compatibility work is that some of the test code had race conditions that would cause failures on Windows that were not showing up at all on Linux, just due to differences in the way the OS chooses to schedule threads.  Running the parallel tests on both Linux and Windows is more likely to reveal race conditions.\n",

          "body": "Thanks for working on this, Andrey.  Overall patch looks good, and I agree the HDFS test changes are tightly coupled with the changes in common.  It would be a pain to tackle these changes in separate JIRAs, and since it's only modifying tests I'm inclined to keep that as one patch.  However the changes to the hadoop-yarn tests have little to do with parallel testing in the hadoop-common project and could trivially be separated.  Could you please move these to a separate YARN JIRA?\n\n[~cnauroth], have you had a chance to kick the tires on this patch for Windows?  Given that the tests do not run in parallel by default, I don't believe the concern about race conditions will affect the Windows build unless it explicitly asks for a parallel test run.  However it would be good to get another datapoint to see if the tests run successfully in parallel on Windows or if there's a test collision that only seems to happen on that platform.",

The community will find this super useful!\n\nI went over the patch and the approach from the patch and have a couple of suggestions/comments:\n - As part of this effort, it would be good to enumerate patterns that can cause concurrent tests to fail (you guys must know them already :)). One is local file system conflict. Another could be conflict on ports. This would be of great help for future development so that the community can keep a watch on those.\n - Instead of changing individual tests to use unique test folder paths, couldn't we just reconfigure test.build.data from the outside (from maven)? This would make tests changes minimal/unnecessary in most cases. The general guideline is to have all tests write local files under test.build.data, so if we have tests that violate this, that's a bug.\n\n\nIMO, it would be really good if we could have a clear set of guidelines that would allow us to reconfigure tests from the outside and have them run in parallel with no conflicts. Not sure how much effort this is, so just putting it on the table. Hope this helps!\n",

          "body": "{quote}\nAs part of this effort, it would be good to enumerate patterns that can cause concurrent tests to fail\n{quote}\n\nThis sounds like good material for the code review checklist.  http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/CodeReviewChecklist\n\n{quote}\nInstead of changing individual tests to use unique test folder paths, couldn't we just reconfigure test.build.data from the outside (from maven)?\n{quote}\n\nThis would be very convenient, but unfortunately, I can't think of a way to make it work.  The problem is that our pom.xml code hands over control to maven-surefire-plugin, which then iterates through each test suite class and executes them.  When execution enters maven-surefire-plugin, the Maven properties are frozen at a specific state.  I don't believe there is any way for our pom.xml code to take back control from maven-surefire-plugin between test suite iterations to generate a different unique ID.  Maybe a custom JUnit runner could do it?  At that point, it might be more trouble than it's worth.  Does anyone else have ideas on this?  I'm also not aware of any built-in unique ID property or external plugins that generate unique IDs, so we might end up needing to code another custom plugin of our own.\n\n{quote}\nChris Nauroth, have you had a chance to kick the tires on this patch for Windows?\n{quote}\n\nResults look good so far.  First, I ran the tests without the parallel-tests profile enabled.  As expected, this caused no harm to the test results on Windows.  That's a great sign!\n\nNext, I enabled parallel-tests with the default thread count of 4.  Performance improvement was similar to what is reported here: from ~15 minutes down to ~8 minutes, and this is on a fairly wimpy VM.  I did see some new failures though:\n\n# There were failures due to test timeouts in TestCopyPreserveFlag (testPutWithP, testPutWithoutP, testGetWithP, testGetWithoutP), and TestLocalFileSystem (testWorkingDirectory, testCopy).  These all have very short timeouts (1s).  I suspect that multi-threaded execution introduced a bit of context-switching overhead that just barely pushed it over the timeout.  I recommend increasing these timeouts to 10s.  Unfortunately, this suggests that timeout settings + parallel execution could be another source of flaky test results in the future.\n# {{TestTFileNoneCodecsByteArrays#testFailureNegativeLength_3}} failed with an EOFException, which makes me think that 2 tests tried to share a file or directory and saw unexpected data.  This inherits from a base class, and I see that the code changes in the base class should have prevented a sharing problem, but perhaps we missed something.  I think we ought to investigate this one before committing.  It's probably not a Windows problem, but rather just a coincidence that the problem manifested on a Windows machine.\n\n[~aklochkov], thanks again for sticking with this issue and responding to the feedback.  This is going to be a big help for developer productivity.  I got pretty excited when the common tests finished so quickly on my machine!  :-)",

          "body": "Thanks Chris! \n\nI spent some time reading over the maven parallel test execution and run into the following:\nhttp://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/fork-options-and-parallel-execution.html\n\nLooks like there is a way to specify distinct property values using the pre-defined surefire.forkNumber property.\n\nI went ahead and tried this out, and it seems to provide the behavior we need. For the prototyping purposes I added the following profile to hadoop common pom.xml without other changes:\n{noformat}\n    <profile>\n      <id>parallel-tests</id>\n      <build>\n        <plugins>\n          <plugin>\n            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>\n            <version>2.14.1</version>\n            <configuration>\n              <forkMode>perthread</forkMode>\n              <threadCount>4</threadCount>\n              <reuseForks>false</reuseForks>\n              <parallel>classes</parallel>\n              <argLine>-Xmx1024m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -DminiClusterDedicatedDirs=true</argLine>\n              <systemPropertyVariables>\n                <test.build.data>I:\\tmp$<curlybrace>surefire.forkNumber<curlybrace></test.build.data>\n              </systemPropertyVariables>\n            </configuration>\n          </plugin>\n        </plugins>\n      </build>\n    </profile>\n{noformat}\n\nAnd the common test runtime decreased on my dev workstation from 17 minutes to less than 5 minutes! Nice!\n\nI noticed 4 additional test case failures in parallel mode (out of the total of 1969), did not investigate yet.\n\nAdditional parameter you’ll notice I’m passing above is reuseForks=false. Otherwise, the same process is reused across test suites. reuseForks will provide additional perf benefit however, it can also cause problems. Default {{mvn test}} also does not reuse the process (if I’m not mistaken), so this seems like the right thing to do as the first step.\n\nThere is one catch though, hadoop tests seem to expect that test.build.data exist, so we’ll have to somehow create test folders before we initiate the test run. “Brute force” approach is to always create for example N predefined test.build.data dirs, test.build.data1, test.build.data2, etc. We might be able to do better though.\n\nLet me know what you think. \n\n",
